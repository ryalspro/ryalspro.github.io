	The title, which previously peaked at No. 12, reaches the top 10 in its 52nd week on the chart &#8212; dating back to its December 2017 debut. This marks the late singer&#8217;s first return to the top 10 since August 2012. That month, his 2008 hits package <em>Nothing But the Best</em> returned to the top 10 (re-entering at No. 3 on the Aug. 25, 2012-dated chart) after sale pricing and promotion. <em>Nothing</em> had previously debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the May 31, 2008-dated chart.</p>

	After 22 months, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/sza"  >SZA</a>’s chart-topping <em>SOS</em> returns No. 1 on the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/"  >Billboard 200</a>, as the set jumps 15-1 on the Jan. 4-dated chart. It bolts back to the top thanks largely from activity generated by the album’s deluxe reissue on Dec. 20 (dubbed <em>SOS Deluxe: LANA</em>) that added 15 additional songs to the album. The set was originally released on Dec. 9, 2022, with 23 tracks. All versions of the album, old and new, are combined for tracking and charting purposes and continue to chart under the title <em>SOS</em>.</p>

	<em>SOS</em> surges to No. 1 with 178,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending Dec. 26 (up 297%), according to Luminate. With its return to No. 1, the set collects an 11th nonconsecutive week atop the list, and its first since the March 4, 2023-dated chart. That 22-month gap between weeks at No. 1 is the longest for any album since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956.</p>







<p

	Notably, had the 15 new songs on the <em>LANA</em> deluxe edition of the album been released as a new stand-alone album, its track activity alone would have been enough for that stand-alone set to debut atop the list. (The 15 new songs generated 105,000 in SEA and TEA units. The No. 2 title this week, Michael Bublé’s former leader <em>Christmas</em>, earned 100,000 units from SEA, TEA and traditional album sales combined.)</p>

	<em>SOS</em> debuted atop the Billboard 200 dated Dec. 24, 2022, and logged 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 on the list through the March 4, 2023-dated chart. It has never left the weekly top 20 of the chart during the 107 consecutive weeks that it has spent on the list. <em>SOS</em> closed 2024 at No. 6 on the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2024/top-billboard-200-albums/"  >year-end Billboard 200 Albums chart</a>, after it was No. 3 on the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2023/top-billboard-200-albums/"  >year-end list in 2023</a>.</p>

(Honorable mention to the Whitney Houston-led soundtrack to <em>The Bodyguard</em>, which logged 20 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 in 1992-93. The 12-track album has six songs by Houston and six songs by other artists.) <em>SOS</em> has the most weeks at No. 1 for any R&amp;B album since <em>The Bodyguard’s</em> 20-week reign. (R&amp;B/hip-hop and R&amp;B albums are defined as those that have hit or are eligible for <em>Billboard</em>’s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top R&amp;B Albums charts, respectively.)</p>

>
	It&#8217;s official: <em>Wicked </em>has pulled ahead of <em>Mamma Mia!</em> to become the top-grossing film based on a Broadway musical. <em>Wicked</em> has grossed $634.4 million worldwide since it opened on Nov. 22. <em>Mamma Mia!</em> grossed $611.5 million worldwide following its release in June 2008.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	You might surmise that both shows must have won the Tony for best musical when they played on Broadway. Actually, neither one did. <em>Wicked</em> lost to <em>Avenue Q</em> in 2004. <em>Mamma Mia!</em> lost to <em>Thoroughly Modern Millie</em> in 2002.</p>



<p

	<a  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ariana-grande/"  data-type="link"  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/ariana-grande/"  >Ariana Grande</a> and <a  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/artist/cynthia-erivo/"  data-type="link"  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/cynthia-erivo/"  >Cynthia Erivo</a> star in <em>Wicked</em>, which was directed by Jon M. Chu, whose hit-studded résumé includes a previous film adaptation of a Broadway musical, the 2021 movie version of <a  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/artist/lin-manuel-miranda/"  data-type="link"  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/lin-manuel-miranda/"  >Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>’s breakout hit <em>In the Heights</em>.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Seven film adaptations of Broadway musicals appear on Box Office Mojo&#8217;s list of the<a  rel="nofollow"  data-id="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW&amp;ref_=bo_cso_ac"  data-type="link"  href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW&#038;ref_=bo_cso_ac"  target="_blank"  > top 1,000 films</a> in terms of their lifetime worldwide grosses. That counts <em>Mamma Mia!</em>, a film adaptation of the 2001 stage musical built around ABBA music, but not its <a  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/artist/cher/"  data-type="link"  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/cher/"  >Cher</a>-featuring sequel <em>Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</em>, on the grounds that the latter was really just a sequel to a hit movie. (The sequel did astonishingly well, with a worldwide gross of $395.6 million.) Of course, not all sequels are guaranteed to become box-office successes. <em>Grease</em> is here, but its 1982 sequel, <em>Grease 2</em>, which grossed just $15 million worldwide, didn&#8217;t come close.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	<em><a  data-id="https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/wicked-part-2-official-title-1235858341/"  data-type="link"  href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/wicked-part-2-official-title-1235858341/"  >Wicked: For Good</a>, </em>previously referred to by the generic title <em>Wicked Part Two</em>, is due for release on Nov. 21, 2025. Will it follow its predecessor to box-office glory? If it does, Chu will join Rob Marshall as the only director with two films on this list; Marshall directed both<em> Chicago </em>and <em>Into the Woods</em>.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Only two of the seven musical-to-film transfers on this list won the Tony for best musical when they played on Broadway. <em>Les Misérables</em> won in 1987. <em>Hairspray</em> won in 2003. Of the other three, <em>Grease</em> lost in 1972 to <em>Two Gentlemen of Verona</em>, <em>Chicago</em> lost in 1976 to <em>A Chorus Line.</em> <em>Into the Woods</em> lost in 1988 to <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	One disclaimer about this list right at the top: You can’t easily compare box-office grosses of films from different eras. The biggest blockbusters of earlier eras simply can’t match the grosses of today’s hits. (It’s not just your imagination that ticket prices are much higher than they used to be.) <em>The Sound of Music</em> has grossed $159.5 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo &#8212; not enough to make their list of 1,000 top-grossing films. But that 1965 adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical is one of the biggest hits in film history.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Other film adaptations of Broadway musicals that have grossed more than $50 million worldwide, but not enough to make the list, include <em>Dreamgirls</em> ($155.5 million), the 2021 version of <em>West Side Story</em> ($76 million), <em>My Fair Lady</em> ($72.7 million) and <em>Funny Girl</em> ($52.2 million).</p>

	The couple made their romance public in December 2023 after dating for several months. Their professional relationship began in 2019, when Gomez and Blanco, a prolific record producer, collaborated on the track “I Can’t Get Enough” with Tainy and J Balvin. In 2023, the pair teamed up for more music, Gomez’s &#8220;Single Soon.&#8221;</p>

	“Thank you to the fans, because&nbsp;<em>Billboard</em>&nbsp;is counting your stuff. They’re counting what you listen to, the albums that you’re passionate about,” she shared in a video message that aired during the telecast. “I count these as fan-voted awards because you’re the ones who care about the albums and come see us in concert. Everything that’s happened with the Eras Tour and&nbsp;<em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, I just have to say thank you. It means the world to me that you guys embraced the things I’ve made, and the fact that you care so much about my music &#8230; This is the nicest early birthday present you could have given me. So, thank you very much. I love it. It’s exactly what I wanted.&#8221;</p>

	In an emotional piece shared with <a  href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/26/quincy-jones-remembered-by-mark-ronson"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >The Guardian</a> on Thursday (Dec. 26), Ronson reflected on his personal experiences working with Jones &#8212; who <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/quincy-jones-dead-at-91-7318782/"  >passed away</a> in November at the age of 91 &#8212; and the profound impact the music icon had on his life and career.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	“Losing Quincy is like a black hole swallowing part of the musical universe,” Ronson wrote. “But his work will live forever, as will his lessons. Keep striving for that deeper knowledge. Always leave space for something bigger than yourself. Because sometimes, magic happens when we get out of the way.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Ronson opened the tribute by recalling a passage from Jones’ 2001 autobiography, <em>Q</em>, in which the legendary musician describes walking away from a successful career in order to study music theory and composition in Paris.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	“Imagine reaching the pinnacle of success, especially as a young Black musician in segregated 1950s America, and saying thanks, but I’m starting over for the sake of chords and harmony,” Ronson wrote. “I fantasize about having that kind of courage.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	“But that’s the peril of holding Quincy as a yardstick,” he continued. “He’s an impossible standard. For producers and arrangers like me, he didn’t just raise the bar; he hid it where no one could reach.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Ronson also reflected on the years he spent with Jones, particularly when he was engaged to the legendary producer&#8217;s daughter, Rashida Jones, in the early 2000s. The two producers also collaborated on the song “Keep Reachin’,” featuring Chaka Khan, for the 2018 <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/features/quincy-jones-interview-85th-birthday-netflix-documentary-8476891/"  >Netflix documentary <em>Quincy</em></a>, directed by Rashida Jones.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	“Over the years, he would send me kind notes &#8212; he had a particular fondness for Amy [Winehouse] &#8212; and we’d often hang out whenever I played the Montreux jazz festival, his beloved stomping ground,” Ronson wrote. “Seeing him there, stage right, seated in his director’s chair &#8212; looking every bit the debonair godfather of music, smiling back at you &#8212; elicited a wild mix of emotions.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	He added, “The greatest producer and arranger of all time, watching your every move, was utterly terrifying. And yet he only radiated generosity. All he wanted was for you to win, to shine. He had already achieved the unimaginable. Now he existed as something rare and beautiful &#8212; a benevolent cheerleader for the wonder of music itself.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Jones passed away on Nov. 3 at his home in Los Angeles. A 28-time Grammy Award winner, Jones was revered for his groundbreaking work as a producer and arranger on iconic albums, including Michael Jackson’s <em>Off the Wall</em> (1979), <em>Thriller</em> (1982) and <em>Bad</em> (1987).</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Jones was also the guiding force behind the recording of the all-star charity single “We Are the World” in 1985, which rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and featured a star-studded lineup of artists, including Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner and Kenny Rogers.</p>

	<a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/hayley-williams/"  >Hayley Williams</a> may be gearing up for her first solo tour in 2025.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	On Friday (Dec. 27), the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/paramore/"  >Paramore</a> frontwoman hinted at the possibility of solo dates in an Instagram Story celebrating her 36th birthday. In her note, Williams reflected on the tour she had to cancel in 2020 in support of her debut solo album, <em>Petals for Armor</em>, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p

	“I’m going to try and finally play some shows next year that would’ve happened nearly 5 years ago now,&#8221; she <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/yelyahwilliams/?hl=en"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >wrote</a>. &#8220;That is, if the world doesn’t f&#8212;ing stop before then. Here’s hoping.&#8221;</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	<em>Petals for Armor</em> was released in March 2020, and Williams had planned a European and North American tour to support the album. However, the <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/hayley-williams-cancels-petals-for-armor-tour-dates/"  >pandemic forced her to cancel</a> those shows as venues around the world shut down.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	“Wow. I am going on tour. Myself. It’s not Paramore and truthfully, it’s just a little terrifying,” she wrote at the time. “But if I know anything, it’s that there’s no safer place (besides at home with my dog) than to be in a room, in front of the people who’ve grown up singing my lungs out for. There was a time I thought I wouldn’t tour Petals for Armor. What a joke. I must.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	During the pandemic, Williams shifted to virtual performances, including an <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/hayley-williams-tiny-desk-concert-9496560/"  >NPR Tiny Desk concert</a> filmed in Nashville, and released her <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/hayley-williams-flowers-album-listen-9521795/"  >surprise sophomore album</a>, <em>Flowers for Vases/Descansos</em>, in 2021.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	In 2023, after the lockdowns lifted, <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/features/paramore-this-is-why-new-album-cover-story-interview-1235201005/"  >Paramore returned</a> with their sixth studio album, <em>This Is Why</em>. The pop-punk band supported the release with a tour that included dates opening for Taylor Swift on her record-breaking Eras Tour.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	In her celebratory post on Instagram, Williams also thanked fans for their well-wishes and shared a personal reflection.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	“35 felt like tilling soil and throwing little seeds down. Waiting, waiting, waiting to see,” she wrote. “36 is exciting and a little scary, already. So much to hope for. I’m still in the dirt, ready for whatever might grow. Fruit?”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How many of these year-end box-office champs have you seen?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- do not apply CSS styles to this element! -->
				<div class="pmc-not-a-paywall">











<p>Most <em>Billboard</em> readers have at least a rough idea of the top albums and songs of each year but may be less familiar with the top box-office hits from each year. Fortunately, <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">boxofficemojo.com</span> has <a  href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/?ref_=bo_nb_hm_secondarytab"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >that information</a> for each year dating back to 1977.</p>
<p>So what do we learn scrolling through the list of top-grossing films for each year since Jimmy Carter became president and Elvis Presley died? One thing that comes across loud and clear is the degree to which sequels and franchises have come to dominate the marketplace. Just five of the year-end box-office champs were films that were <em>not</em> part of franchises (or did not spark a franchise or a reboot of some kind). Those five films that stand alone are <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Ghost,</em> <em>Titanic </em>and <em>Barbie.</em></p>
<p><em>Star Wars</em> is the top franchise on this recap, with six installments that have been the year’s top-grossing film. <em>Batman</em> is runner-up, with four installments that finished first for the year. <em>Spider-Man</em> is third, with three installments that yielded the year’s top box-office hit.</p>
<p>James Cameron and George Lucas are tied as the only directors who each directed three films that took the year-end crown. Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Tony Scott, Steven Spielberg, Andrew Stanton and Robert Zemeckis are tied for second place, each having directed two year-end champs.</p>
<p><a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/john-williams/"  >John Williams</a> is far and away the top film scorer. The legendary composer scored 10 films that took the year-end box-office crown. <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/danny-elfman/"  >Danny Elfman,</a> <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/alan-silvestri-composer-interview-8541590/"  >Alan Silvestri</a> and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/hans-zimmer/"  >Hans Zimmer</a> have each scored films that finished first four times.</p>
<p>Lucas and Williams are the only director/composer team to collaborate on three year-end box-office champs. Six other such teams have collaborated on two year-end champs: Spielberg and Williams; Zemeckis and Silvestri; Scott and Faltermeyer; Cameron and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/james-horner-best-movie-scores-ranked-6605869/"  >James Horner</a>; Burton and Elfman; and Stanton and <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/thomas-newman/"  >Thomas Newman</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s scroll back through the films that had the most success at the domestic box office (that’s the U.S. and Canada) in each calendar year since 1977, when <em>Annie</em> debuted on Broadway, <em>Laverne &amp; Shirley</em> was the top TV show and Fleetwood Mac’s <em>Rumours</em> dominated the Billboard 200.</p>

	Knowles began by <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEGEPKBSWf2/?hl=en"  rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"  >reposting a fan’s message</a> on Instagram that called out those who had negative things to say about the performance.“Irrespective of whether you like Beyoncé’s music or not, it is PROOF and motivation that no matter how undeniably talented you are, people will always, ALWAYS, always have some negative ish to say,” the fan’s comment read.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	In her caption, Knowles agreed with the fan, writing, &#8220;My sentiments exactly! It is mind-boggling to me that you would take your precious Christmas day and watch a performance of someone you hate and you don’t think has talent so that you can go talk ish about it later.&#8221;</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	She continued, “Obviously you are so obsessed with them , addicted to them , and secretly admire them , wish you could be them, that you cannot help but to watch and critique and comment and say dumb ridiculous stuff that makes you look like a joke !! So go to another channel when it’s halftime watch goofy cartoons or Bozo the clown or something you can relate to and see yourself in. Said with love.”</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Knowles also reflected on her daughter’s strength, adding, “I have learned so much from her warrior spirit, of when they go low I work harder &#8216;No weapon formed against me shall prosper&#8217; one ,two , three waiting for the fake bots to come&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	She followed up with several posts celebrating the positive reactions to Bey’s performance, including a <a  rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEGW8ezS4lB/?hl=en"  target="_blank"  >comment from Bun B</a>, who praised the superstar’s career: “I think quietly, this entire time we’ve watched her rise. She’s probably the single most intentional performer, musician and entertainer in our culture. Beyoncé knows exactly who she is, and she understands that when she does something, things change,” the rapper said.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	The Houston-born superstar’s halftime show featured songs from her latest album <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, a country-infused project that topped the Billboard 200 for two weeks. The performance included collaborations with Shaboozey, Post Malone, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer and others, showcasing tracks like &#8220;16 Carriages&#8221; to &#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em,&#8221; &#8220;Levii&#8217;s Jeans&#8221; and &#8220;Jolene.&#8221; Beyoncé’s 12-year-old daughter <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/blue-ivy-carter/"  >Blue Ivy Carter</a> also joined her on stage as a dancer, just as she did on the Renaissance World Tour.</p>



<p
		class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   "
>
	Following the performance, Beyoncé <a  href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/beyonce-teases-2025-project-fans-cowboy-carter-tour-1235865678/"  >teased a new project</a> set for release in 2025. In a cryptic post on social media, she shared a video of herself riding a majestic white horse while waving an American flag. The clip ended with a black screen featuring the message: “1.14.25.” She simply captioned the post with, “Look at that horse.”</p>
